# Wilfire Prediction Model and Fire Danger Index Mapping in Jonkershoek Nature Reserve

---

## Overview
This project focuses on identifying the main factors that affect wildfire risk in the Jonkershoek Nature Reserve in Stellenbosch. The factors that will be analysed include topography, vegetation, and weather data. The objectives include identifying the most influencial risk factors, using the factors as predictors to develop a fire prediction model that outputs a Fire Danger Index, and assessing these factors over time to better understand trends in wildfire risk. This repository provides all the project deliverables, from initial scope planning to final results, including source data, analysis scripts, reports, and presentation material.

## Tools Used
- `Python`: Used for calculating the Fire Danger Index (FDI), building the fire prediction model, and creating visualisations.
- `R`: Used for data wrangling, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis.
