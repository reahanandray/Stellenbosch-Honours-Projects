# Stellenbosch-Honours-Projects
This repository is a collection of programming and software development projects completed during my BSc(Hons) in Geoinformatics  at Stellenbosch University. These projects demonstrate the application of data science, geospatial analysis, and computer science programming, to solve real-world spatial and environmental problems.

## Projects 

- **Unsupervised Classification and Change Detection of Flooding in South Africa**  
  Using Google Earth Engine API to map and monitor vegetation health, soil moisture, and surface water extent before, during, and after a flood event.
  <br>*Tech: Java, `CHIRPS`, `MODIS`.* 

- **Hyperspectral Remote Sensing using Machine Learning for Raisin Cultivar Classification**  
  This study compares the performance of Random Forest and XGBoost classifiers on leaf and canopy hyperspectral datasets for crop identification.
  <br>*Tech: Python, `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`, `xgboost`, `RandomForestClassifier`, `boruta`, and `collections`*  

- **Wilfire Prediction Model and Fire Danger Index Mapping in Jonkershoek Nature Reserve**  
  Created a spatial output and classification report for model performance (RF, XGB, SVM) comparison of fire danger likelihood in Jonkershoek using historical fire data, weather, and     topographical data.
  <br>*Tech: Python,`rasterio`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `geopandas`, `shapely`, `contextily`, and `datetime`, R programming.*
